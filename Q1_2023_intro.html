<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Stewardship and judgement tend to go hand in hand. We are all given freedoms and responsibilities. You could say we are "stewards" of them. That stewardship is then evaluated which you could call judgement. For this quarter, we are going to look at our role as God's children, more specifically stewards of the creator. In the old testament, God gave the children of Israel a set of conditional blessings and curses that they should remember. He was very transparent on how he would judge. In Malachi, God talks about who he will send to judge. In Proverbs, Solomon gives practical advice on how to be a good steward. These counsels are not specifically judgements but more like natural results of good or bad stewardship. We'll then move on to examples from Jesus and the early church. Jesus revealed how God will evaluate our lives through parables. He counseled us to make the most of what we have and be ready. Looking back to the sacrifice of Christ, Paul encouraged believers to be faithful in the ir earthly duties. And looking forward to the future, Jesus and John give us glimpses of God's faithful people in the last days. This is going to be an exciting lesson full of new insight for everyone! I'm looking forward to you joining me. </p>
